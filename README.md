# Angular Portfolio
A full stack web app created from scratch using the Angular framework, a serverless AWS Lambda backend, and mySQL. An AWS Lambda backend will process and store contact information in a mySQL database.

## This Repository
This repository contains the angular frontend for a portfolio website.

## Reuse
For use of this website, the assets/projects.json should be changed, and the /assets/resume.pdf should be updated. Icons should be changed, and another web API should be created and used to post the contact JSON file.

# Angular Details

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.0.7.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
